# Climate-Similarity-Metrics
Which similarity metrics are the most helpful to understand climate? 

## Goal of the Project
Create a modular framework for analysing and understanding relationships in climate data. The moduls should allow for testing different climate indices, similarity metrics, and time-scales. The results should be interpretable by climate scientists.

## Data Description

The the *u* component (east-west) of the wind for 512 longitudes, 256 latitudes, and 37 altitudes aggregated by months.

## Data Setup

1. Download `era-int_pl_1981-mm-u.nc` file from this [repository](https://nextcloud.scc.kit.edu/s/cwpp3wdQPcm96jq). 
2. Place the data file `era-int_pl_1981-mm-u.nc` in the directory `data/`.
