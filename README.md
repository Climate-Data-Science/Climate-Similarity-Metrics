## Goal of the Project
Create a modular framework for analysing and understanding relationships in climate data. The moduls should allow for testing different climate indices, similarity metrics, and time-scales. The results should be interpretable by climate scientists.

## Data Description

The the *u* component (east-west) of the wind for 512 longitudes, 256 latitudes, and 37 altitudes aggregated by months.

## Data Setup

1. Download `era-int_pl_1981-mm-u.nc` file from this [repository](https://nextcloud.scc.kit.edu/s/cwpp3wdQPcm96jq).
2. Place the data file `era-int_pl_1981-mm-u.nc` in the directory `data/`.
3. Use `era-int_pl_1979-2019-mm-u.nc` file from this [repository](https://nextcloud.scc.kit.edu/s/cwpp3wdQPcm96jq) for the "Data Preprocessing" step

##  Data Preprocessing
Use the data manipulation tool cdo to extract all values for pressure level 3, 30, 70 and 300 hPa.
Example for extracting values for pressure level 30 with the following command:

`cdo -select,level=30 era-int_pl_1979-2019-mm-u.nc era-int_pl_1979-2019-mm-l30-u.nc`

Analogously for 3, 70 and 300

## Environment Setup

1. Create a new conda environment with all the required dependencies:

`conda env create -f environment.yaml`

2. Activate the environment:

`conda activate climate_similarity_measures`

3. Navigate to the `Randomized Dependence Coefficient` folder and run `python setup.py install`

## QBO Index

### 1st Possibility

Values at Singapore (1N, 104E) at pressure level 30 hPa

### 2nd Possibility

Values at +- 5Â°north and south of the equator at pressure level 30 hPa

### Data from the Internet to cross check

Data to cross check can be found under the following link:

https://acd-ext.gsfc.nasa.gov/Data_services/met/qbo/QBO_Singapore_Uvals_GSFC.txt

The file has to be placed in the directory `data/`

You have to **remove the first 9 lines** in order to make it readable for Python.
